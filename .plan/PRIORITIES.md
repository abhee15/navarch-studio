# Improvement Priorities Roadmap

Planned improvements after Phase 8 completion. Each phase focuses on one key area.

## Phase 9: Monitoring & Observability Overview ðŸ”´

**Status**: Planning  
**Why**: Currently blind to production issues - no logs, metrics, or error tracking  
**Note**: Split into multiple focused phases for better learning

## Phase 10: CloudWatch Logging (CRITICAL) âœ…

**Status**: **COMPLETED**  
**Why**: Can't debug production issues without logs  
**What**: Structured logging with Serilog + CloudWatch (5GB/month free)  
**File**: `.plan/phase10-logging.md` âœ…  
**Completed**: October 2024  
**Implementation**:
- âœ… Serilog installed in all 3 services
- âœ… Correlation ID middleware for distributed tracing
- âœ… CloudWatch integration with log groups per service
- âœ… Structured JSON logging with enrichers
- âœ… 7-day retention, stays within free tier (5GB/month)

## Phase 11: Security Hardening ðŸŸ 

**Status**: Not Started  
**Why**: Protect against attacks (rate limiting, DDoS, injection)  
**What**: WAF, rate limiting, security headers, RBAC, audit logs

## Phase 12: Testing Coverage ðŸŸ¡

**Status**: Not Started  
**Why**: Catch bugs before users do  
**What**: E2E tests (Playwright), integration tests, code coverage

## Phase 13: Developer Experience ðŸŸ¢

**Status**: Not Started  
**Why**: Make development faster and easier  
**What**: Pre-commit hooks, hot reload, better tooling

## Phase 14: Performance Optimization ðŸ”µ

**Status**: Not Started  
**Why**: Faster app = better user experience  
**What**: Caching (Redis), compression, CDN optimization

## How We'll Proceed

For each phase:

1. **Understand WHY** - Learn the problem we're solving
2. **Plan WHAT** - Detailed implementation plan in phase file
3. **Implement HOW** - Step-by-step with explanations
4. **Test & Verify** - Ensure it works as expected
5. **Document** - Update phase file with completion status

This is a learning journey, not just copy-paste.
