# Phase 9: Monitoring & Observability

## üéØ Goal
Add comprehensive monitoring to understand what's happening in production.

## ü§î The Problem (WHY)

**Right now, if something breaks in production:**
- ‚ùå **No error tracking** - Users report bugs, you have no details
- ‚ùå **No logging** - Can't see what happened before the crash
- ‚ùå **No metrics** - Don't know if app is slow or servers overloaded
- ‚ùå **No alerts** - Discover issues hours/days later

**Real scenario**: User says "I got an error at checkout"  
‚Üí You have NO idea what happened, can't reproduce, can't fix

## üí° The Solution (WHAT)

Three layers of observability:

### 1. Structured Logging
**What**: Consistent JSON logs with context (user ID, request ID, timestamp)  
**Why**: Search and filter logs easily  
**Tools**: Serilog (.NET), CloudWatch Logs

### 2. Error Tracking
**What**: Automatic error capture with stack traces and context  
**Why**: See all errors in one place with details  
**Tools**: Sentry (frontend + backend)

### 3. Metrics & Dashboards
**What**: Visual dashboards showing app health (requests/sec, errors, latency)  
**Why**: Spot issues before users complain  
**Tools**: CloudWatch Dashboards, custom metrics

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you'll understand:
- Why observability matters in production
- How to implement structured logging
- How to track errors with full context
- How to create CloudWatch dashboards
- How to set up alerts for critical issues
- The difference between logs, metrics, and traces

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

[Steps will be added as we implement together]

### Prerequisites
- Phase 8 completed
- Understanding of JSON and logging concepts
- AWS CloudWatch basics (we'll explain as we go)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All services log to CloudWatch with structured JSON
- [ ] Errors automatically tracked in Sentry
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboard showing key metrics
- [ ] Alerts set up for critical issues (high error rate, service down)
- [ ] Can debug production issues using logs and errors

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (learning + implementation)
