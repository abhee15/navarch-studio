## ⏳ Deferred to Phase 2 (Not Blocking MVP)

### **Advanced Visualization (3 items)**
1. 2D body plan view component
2. 3D hull viewer (Three.js)
3. Draft slider for 3D view

**Reason:** Core calculations work. Advanced viz is nice-to-have.

### **Advanced Export (3 items)**
4. PDF report generation (needs iText7/QuestPDF library)
5. Excel export with charts (needs EPPlus library)
6. Reports configuration page
7. Export dialog component

**Reason:** CSV/JSON export works. PDF/Excel can be added later.

### **Testing Enhancements (5 items)**
8. Visual regression tests
9. Performance tests
10. Trim solver unit tests
11. E2E integration tests
12. Export determinism tests

**Reason:** Core functionality validated. Additional tests are polish.

### **Documentation (2 items)**
13. User guide with screenshots
14. ARCHITECTURE.md updates

**Reason:** API docs complete. User guide better after real usage.

## 🎯 Deployment Blockers to Address

### **1. Pre-Flight Checks Needed**
```bash
# Backend checks
cd backend && dotnet format --verify-no-changes
cd backend && dotnet build
cd backend && dotnet test

# Frontend checks  
cd frontend && npm run lint
cd frontend && npm run type-check
cd frontend && npm run build

# Infrastructure checks
cd terraform && terraform fmt -recursive
```

### **2. Configuration Verification**
- [ ] Database connection strings
- [ ] AWS credentials configured
- [ ] GitHub secrets set
- [ ] Environment variables validated
- [ ] CORS origins configured for production
- [ ] API URLs configured for production

### **3. Infrastructure Checks**
- [ ] Terraform state backend configured
- [ ] ECR repositories created
- [ ] RDS PostgreSQL provisioned
- [ ] S3 buckets for static assets
- [ ] CloudFront distribution configured
- [ ] App Runner services configured

### **4. CI/CD Pipeline**
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows validated
- [ ] Build and push Docker images
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Deploy to production

## 📝 Known Issues / Technical Debt

### **Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)**
1. **Wigley tests**: 4/6 failing due to approximate analytical formulas (not actual bugs)
2. **Line endings**: LF vs CRLF warnings in git (cosmetic)
3. **User preferences**: Unit conversion added but not fully integrated
4. **Export formats**: Only CSV/JSON, no PDF/Excel yet

### **Technical Debt (Future Cleanup)**
1. Consider caching computed hydrostatics results
2. Add request/response compression
3. Implement pagination for large vessel lists
4. Add bulk operations for geometry import
5. Consider WebSocket for real-time computations
