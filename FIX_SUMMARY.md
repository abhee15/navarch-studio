# Production Error Fix - Complete Summary

## üîç Issue Diagnosis

You were experiencing two related errors in production:

### 1. **Vessel Creation 500 Error**

```
POST https://qqctyzzmz4.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/hydrostatics/vessels 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

### 2. **Settings Load Error**

```
Failed to load settings: rt
```

## üéØ Root Cause

The **Unit Conversion Service** was failing to initialize because it couldn't find the configuration file `unit-systems.xml`. This caused:

- Any vessel creation request to fail with 500 error (unit conversion is used during vessel creation)
- Potential issues with settings loading due to the same underlying problem

### Why It Happened

1. **Incorrect Path**: Program.cs was constructing a path to `unit-systems.xml` instead of using the default `config/unit-systems.xml`
2. **Missing File**: The `.csproj` files didn't explicitly copy the config file to the output directory
3. **Wrong Docker Context**: The build script was using `backend/` as context, which couldn't access `packages/` directory

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Unit Converter Initialization

**Files:** `backend/DataService/Program.cs`, `backend/ApiGateway/Program.cs`

Changed from explicitly specifying path to using default:

```csharp
// Now uses default path: config/unit-systems.xml
new NavArch.UnitConversion.Services.UnitConverter(null)
```

### 2. Ensured Config File is Copied

**Files:** `backend/DataService/DataService.csproj`, `backend/ApiGateway/ApiGateway.csproj`

Added explicit copy instruction:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="..\..\packages\unit-conversion\config\unit-systems.xml">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    <Link>config\unit-systems.xml</Link>
  </None>
</ItemGroup>
```

### 3. Fixed Docker Build Context

**File:** `scripts/build-and-push.ps1`

Changed all Docker builds to use root directory as context:

```powershell
docker build -t $REPO:latest -f backend/Service/Dockerfile .
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**File:** `backend/DataService/Controllers/VesselsController.cs`

Added catch-all exception handler for better error messages:

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Unexpected error creating vessel");
    return StatusCode(500, new { error = "...", details = ex.Message });
}
```

## üìã Verification Completed

‚úÖ Backend builds successfully  
‚úÖ Config file present in build output  
‚úÖ Docker image builds successfully  
‚úÖ Config file verified in Docker image  
‚úÖ All services compile without errors

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Run this single command to deploy the fix:

```powershell
.\scripts\quick-deploy-fix.ps1 -Environment dev
```

This script will:

1. ‚úÖ Build backend locally to verify fixes
2. ‚úÖ Build and push Docker images to ECR
3. ‚úÖ Deploy updated services to AWS App Runner
4. ‚úÖ Provide verification instructions

### Manual Deploy (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer manual steps:

1. **Build and verify locally:**

   ```powershell
   cd backend
   dotnet clean
   dotnet build
   ```

2. **Build and push Docker images:**

   ```powershell
   cd ..
   .\scripts\build-and-push.ps1 -Environment dev
   ```

3. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Environment dev
   ```

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### 1. Check CloudWatch Logs

- Go to AWS Console > CloudWatch > Log Groups
- Find: `/aws/apprunner/navarch-studio-dev-data-service`
- Look for: `"Unit conversion service registered with default config path"`
- Should NOT see: Any errors about `unit-systems.xml` not found

### 2. Test Settings Endpoint

```bash
curl https://qqctyzzmz4.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/v1/users/settings
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "preferredUnits": "SI"
}
```

### 3. Test Vessel Creation

Via frontend:

1. Login to application
2. Navigate to Hydrostatics section
3. Click "Create Vessel"
4. Fill in vessel details
5. Click "Create"
6. Should succeed without 500 error

## üìä Expected Results

After deployment:

- ‚úÖ Vessel creation works without errors
- ‚úÖ Settings load correctly (no "rt" error)
- ‚úÖ Unit conversion works properly
- ‚úÖ All hydrostatic calculations function correctly

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Vessel Creation Still Fails:

1. **Check Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker pull <your-ecr-url>/navarch-studio-data-service:latest
   docker run --rm --entrypoint ls <your-ecr-url>/navarch-studio-data-service:latest -la config/
   ```

   Should show `unit-systems.xml`

2. **Check App Runner Logs:**

   - AWS Console > App Runner > Your Service > Logs
   - Look for startup errors
   - Verify environment variables are set

3. **Verify Database Connection:**
   - Check RDS security groups allow App Runner access
   - Verify connection string in environment variables
   - Check database is accessible

### If Settings Still Return "rt" Error:

This was likely a response parsing issue. After the fix:

- The endpoint should return proper JSON
- Frontend should parse it correctly
- No truncated error messages

- **Unit Conversion Package:** `packages/unit-conversion/README.md`
- **Deployment Guide:** `README.md`

## üéâ Summary

The production errors were caused by a missing configuration file for the unit conversion service. All fixes have been applied and verified locally. You're ready to deploy!

**Next Step:** Run `.\scripts\quick-deploy-fix.ps1 -Environment dev` to deploy the fix to AWS.
