# Products Table Cleanup Summary

## Overview

Removed all Products-related code from the NavArch Studio project as it was part of the initial template and not relevant to the naval architecture application.

## Changes Made

### Backend - Shared Project

**Files Deleted:**

- `backend/Shared/Models/Product.cs` - Product entity model
- `backend/Shared/DTOs/ProductDto.cs` - Product DTO
- `backend/Shared/Validators/CreateProductDtoValidator.cs` - Product validation
- `backend/Shared/TestData/ProductFactory.cs` - Product test data factory

### Backend - DataService

**Files Deleted:**

- `backend/DataService/Controllers/ProductsController.cs` - Products API controller
- `backend/DataService/Services/ProductService.cs` - Product service implementation
- `backend/DataService/Services/IProductService.cs` - Product service interface

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/DataService/Data/DataDbContext.cs`
  - Removed `DbSet<Product> Products` property
  - Removed Product entity configuration from `OnModelCreating`
  - Removed Product from `UpdateTimestamps` method
- `backend/DataService/Program.cs`
  - Removed `IProductService` service registration
  - Commented out FluentValidation registration (no validators currently needed)

**Files Created:**

- `backend/DataService/Migrations/20251026000000_RemoveProductsTable.cs` - Migration to drop Products table
- `backend/DataService/Migrations/20251026000000_RemoveProductsTable.Designer.cs` - Migration designer file

**Files Modified:**

- `backend/DataService/Migrations/DataDbContextModelSnapshot.cs` - Updated to remove Product entity

### Backend - ApiGateway

**Files Deleted:**

- `backend/ApiGateway/Controllers/ProductsController.cs` - Products proxy controller

### Frontend

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/stores/DataStore.ts`

  - Removed `Product` interface
  - Removed `products` array
  - Removed `fetchProducts()` method
  - Converted to a generic data store for future use

- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

  - Removed all Products section UI
  - Removed Product imports and references
  - Removed `dataStore.fetchProducts()` call
  - Cleaned up unused imports

- `frontend/src/stores/__tests__/DataStore.test.ts`
  - Removed all Product-related tests
  - Simplified to basic store initialization test

### Database

**Files Modified:**

- `database/seeds/dev-seed.sql`
  - Removed Products seed data
  - Kept Users seed data
  - Added placeholder comment for future seed data

## Migration Instructions

To apply the database migration:

```bash
# Using docker-compose (recommended for local development)
docker-compose exec dataservice dotnet ef database update

# Or manually if running local database
cd backend/DataService
dotnet ef database update
```

This will drop the `data.Products` table from your database.

## Verification

All changes have been verified:

- ✅ Backend builds successfully (DataService, ApiGateway, Shared)
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ No linter errors in any modified files

## Impact

**Breaking Changes:**

- Products API endpoints no longer available
- Products table will be dropped from database

**Non-Breaking:**

- All hydrostatics functionality remains intact
- User authentication and authorization unchanged
- Infrastructure and deployment configuration unchanged

## Notes

The application is now focused exclusively on naval architecture features (Hydrostatics module). The generic `DataStore` has been retained for future use with application-specific data.

If you need to rollback this change, the migration's `Down()` method will recreate the Products table, but you'll need to restore the code files from git history.
