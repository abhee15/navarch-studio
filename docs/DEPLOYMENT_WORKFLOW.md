# Deployment Workflow

## Simple Deployment Flow

This template uses a streamlined deployment process optimized for quick iteration:

```
Git Push (main) ‚Üí Dev (automatic) ‚Üí Staging (manual) ‚Üí Prod (manual)
```

## Automatic Deployment (Dev)

Every push to the `main` branch automatically triggers a **Dev** deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
git push origin main  # ‚Üê Triggers Dev deployment
```

**What happens:**

1. ‚úÖ Quality checks run FIRST (ESLint, TypeScript, dotnet format, tests)
   - If ANY check fails: workflow stops, nothing deploys (fail-fast)
   - If ALL pass: proceeds with build and deployment
2. ‚úÖ Docker images built and pushed to ECR
3. ‚úÖ Infrastructure deployed to Dev environment
4. ‚úÖ Database migrations run
5. ‚úÖ Frontend deployed to CloudFront
6. ‚úÖ Smoke tests verify deployment

**Monitor progress:**

- Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions`
- Watch the "Deploy to Dev" workflow

## Manual Deployment (Staging)

When Dev is stable and you want to test in a staging environment:

1. Go to GitHub: **Actions** ‚Üí **Deploy to Staging** ‚Üí **Run workflow**
2. Click **Run workflow** on the `main` branch
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~10-15 minutes)

**Use staging for:**

- Final testing before production
- Client demos
- Integration testing with external services
- Performance testing

## Manual Deployment (Production)

When Staging is stable and you're ready to go live:

1. Go to GitHub: **Actions** ‚Üí **Deploy to Production** ‚Üí **Run workflow**
2. Enter a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Approve the deployment (requires manual approval)
5. Wait for deployment to complete (~10-15 minutes)

**Production is special:**

- Requires manual approval for safety
- Uses larger instance sizes for better performance
- Enables Multi-AZ for high availability
- Has longer backup retention (30 days)

## Quick Reference

| Environment | Trigger                   | When to Use                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Dev**     | Push to `main`            | Every commit, rapid iteration |
| **Staging** | Manual trigger            | Pre-production testing, demos |
| **Prod**    | Manual trigger + approval | Production releases           |

## PR Checks

Every pull request automatically runs:

- ‚úÖ TypeScript/React linting and tests
- ‚úÖ .NET build and tests
- ‚úÖ Terraform validation
- ‚úÖ Security scanning

**Merge when:** All checks pass ‚úÖ

## Environment URLs

After deployment, find your URLs in the workflow logs:

**Dev:**

```
Frontend: https://xxx.cloudfront.net
API Gateway: https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Identity Service: https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Data Service: https://xxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

**Staging/Prod:**

- Same pattern, different URLs
- Optionally configure custom domains

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:

### Option 1: Revert and Redeploy

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main  # ‚Üê Triggers new Dev deployment
```

### Option 2: Destroy and Recreate

```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí Destroy Environment
# Select environment (dev/staging/prod)
# Type "DESTROY" to confirm
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Destroying deletes all data in that environment!

## Cost Optimization

To minimize AWS costs during development:

1. **Use Dev environment only** - Skip staging if not needed
2. **Destroy when not in use:**
   ```bash
   # Destroy dev environment after work hours
   # Recreate next day (Phase 4 resources persist)
   ```
3. **Monitor AWS costs:**
   - Check AWS Budgets alerts
   - Review Cost Explorer for anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails with "Backend not found"

**Problem:** Phase 4 not completed  
**Solution:** See `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PREREQUISITES.md`

### Deployment succeeds but app doesn't work

**Problem:** Missing environment variables or secrets  
**Solution:** Verify all GitHub secrets are configured

### Docker image push fails

**Problem:** ECR repositories don't exist  
**Solution:** Run Phase 4 to create ECR repositories

### Terraform state lock error

**Problem:** Previous deployment didn't complete  
**Solution:**

```bash
# Wait 5-10 minutes for lock to expire, then retry
# OR manually release lock in DynamoDB table
```

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Push to `main` frequently for continuous deployment
- Test in Dev before promoting to Staging
- Use semantic commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- Monitor deployment logs for errors
- Run smoke tests after deployment

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Push directly to Staging/Prod (use manual triggers)
- Deploy to Prod without testing in Dev first
- Skip PR checks by pushing with `--no-verify`
- Leave Dev environment running 24/7 if not needed
- Deploy on Fridays (unless necessary üòÖ)
